sperf 0.7.0-beta
----------------
* moving back to go for deployment and speedup gains. Putting 0.6.x in LTS and will continue to develop and support
enchancements to the tooling for a very long time. We may not support massive changes to Python and we may drop
support for the built binaries as they are problematic to generate. We will take new PRs to the Python code base only
and will allow the tooling to drift a bit, but will make every effort to keep the tooling in sync as much as possible.
